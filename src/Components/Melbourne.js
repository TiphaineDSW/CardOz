              the point in barbecuing at which they are added, the role smoke plays, the equipment and fuel used, cooking temperature, and cooking time.
              The meat may be ground, for hamburgers, or processed into sausage or kebabs. 
              The meat may be marinated or rubbed with spices before cooking, basted with a sauce or oil before, during or after cooking, or any combination of these.

        but is now a memorial to all Australians who have served in war. 
        It is a site of annual observances of ANZAC Day (25 April) and Remembrance Day (11 November) and is one of the largest war memorials in Australia.

        In South Australia, many little penguin colony declines have been identified across the state. 
        In some cases, colonies have declined to extinction (including the Neptune Islands, West Island, Wright Island, 
        Pullen Island and several colonies on western Kangaroo Island), while others have declined from thousands of animals to few 
        (Granite Island and Kingscote). 
        A report released in 2011 presented evidence supporting the listing of the statewide population or the more closely monitored sub-population from St. 
        Vincent's Gulf as Vulnerable under South Australia's National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. As of 2014, the little penguin is not listed as a species of conservation concern,
        despite ongoing declines at many colonies.
